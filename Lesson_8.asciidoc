= Udacity/GWG Mobile Web Nanodegree notes. Lesson 8

= Images with Markup

To go back to the README where all the chapters are: click link:README.asciidoc[here].

Sorry! I just received an email saying I was taking a little too long and I'm falling behind. 
I'm only going to be writing notes on things that I didn't know beforehand. 
toc::[]

== 8.1 Performance 
== 8.2 Text Problems 

Text in the image is a bad idea because when scaled, you can see the artifacts. Also, 
it increases latency and page loads which is always bad. 

Another bad thing about that is that the text that are graphics cannot be found by search engines.
Also, it cannot be seen by screen readers or other similar technologies. 

Preferrably it's best to use fewer images. 

== 8.3 CSS Techniques

Using cool CSS effects will affect load time. 

* Gradient = 0.05
* keyframe animation = 0.05
* border radius = 0.06
* Box shadow = 0.12 

* combined = 0.19

It won't make much of a difference on desktop, but definitely on mobile.

== 8.6 Symbol characters 

To avoid using more images, there's a nifty site for simple images: 

link:http://unicode-table.com/en/[]


== 8.7 Quiz: Unicode Treble Clef 

There are more than 110,000 unicode characters. 

In order to use these unicodes, be sure to set it the charset to *utf-8*

`<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">`

Question: What is the HTML code for: ùÑû  (Treble Clef)

== 8.8 Icon Fonts 

There's a cool website for icons and they are icon fonts. No need for images
for these little icons anymore:  link:http://www.weloveiconfonts.com[]

''''
The instructor shows that the CSS for the icon next to the text uses the *:before* pseudo on 
the class name *zocial-*.

----
[class*="zocial-"]:before {
    display: inline-block;
    font-family: 'zocial', sans-serif;
    text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #aaa;
    width: 20vw;
}
----

so now anything with *zocial-* in their class name will import that as well. 

at the top has an import to an external css file 

`@import url(http://weloveiconfonts.com/api/?family=zocial)`

== 8.9 Inlining images with SVG and data URLs 


When it comes to inlining images, there's *SVG* and there's *Data URI* 


*SVG PROS:*

* Optimization tools can help reduce svg size. 
* Powerful.
* Interactive 
* Responsive
* Small file
* Can be inline in CSS
* Reduces HTTP request

*SVG CONS:*

* It has good support but missing Opera Mini. 


*DATA URI PROS:*

* slightly smaller than svg
* Responsive 
* Well supported. Even opera mini supports it.
* Can be inline in CSS
* Reduces HTTP request 

*DATA URI CONS:*
* you can include the file data as inline as a base 64 encoded string. 
----
`<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,[data]">`
----

* The full version is about 5k characters

I had a bit of trouble with this. Remember, they want it done their way even if this 
lesson showed it differently.

Answer:
Meta has to have *charset="utf-8"*. Make it minimal:

`<meta charset="utf-8">`

zocial:

css:
