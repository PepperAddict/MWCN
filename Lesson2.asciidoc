== 2.1 Defining the Viewport

In this lesson we will learn how to optimize our pages for different screen sizes.
Whether it's desktop or mobile. We will learn the difference between CSS and device-independent pixels, and we will 
learn how to choose the right sizes for different elements. 

In the end of the lesson we will learn how to build a mobile version of the hometown site.


The two instructors are discussing what the issue is with non mobile friendly websites and why
they are like that. 

The issue is that the viewport is not set properly. 
Viewport defines the area of the screen that the browser can render content to.

== 2.2 Pixels, pixels, and moar pixels!

In this lesson we are going to try and understand pixels further. 

In the example, they use a tablet. The tablet will have 1600 hardware pixels.
The browser reports the width of the *device independent pixels* aka DIPs. In this
lesson, this tablet only has 800 DIPs. 

A device independent pixels is a unit of measurement, that actually relates pixels to a real distance. The 
idea being that a device independent pixel will take up the same amount of space on a display
regardless of the pixel density of the display.

The browser has a viewport width of 1280 DIPs gets scaled up to 2560 hardware pixels. 

Now, in the case that the viewport isn't set for a webpage, by default, the webpage will work on a screen 
that is 980 DIPs wide.  If the website was a normal 1080px hardware pixel device pixel ratio: 3  and then it'll get 
sent to mobile phone with the scaled 360 DIPs wide.. 
the content will look horribly scaled. Like this: +

It does have its own way of handling this with *font-boosting*. Font boosting is when it tries 
to pick the primary content on the page and scale it up. 


== 2.3 Quiz: Pixelation

Question: You look up the tech specs for the screen of a mobile device and find 
it has a resolution of *1920x1080 pixels*. What kind of *pixels* are the tech specs referencing?

* A. Device Independent Pixels( DIPs) 
* B. CSS Pixels. 
* C. Hardware Pixels. 


====
The answer is: 
C. Hardware Pixels. 

A resolution of anything is the actual physical pixels on the device which is independent 
from what the browser will use.
====


== 2.4 Quiz: Calculating DPR

Question: Which of the following diagrams demonstrates a display with a device pixel ratio of 2?
image:img/lesson2/quiz2-4.png[]


====
the answer is the 2x2 square box because it has 2 DIPs across and down.
====

== 2.5 Quiz: What's the difference

Question: 

Why would the same website look different on screens of identical resolutions?

* A. CSS Styles aren't rendered predictably. 
* B. The device pixel ratio differs between devices.
* C. <meta>'s initial-scale causes inconsistent zooming on different devices.
* D. The viewport wasn't set.

====
A. No, because in the situation between the two devices is not caused by the CSS. +
B. Yes, because different device pixel ratios can definitely change the size of content on 
the page if you don't handle it correctly. +
C. No, because the initial scale isn't going to cause the inconsistent zooming that you see on the example. +
D. Yes, because when you don't define the viewport, you're leaving it up to the browser to figure it out which will 
cause a disparity that is seen there with font boosting.
====

== 2.6 Quiz: Calculating CSS Pixels

Question: A mobile screen has a resolution of *1920 x 1080 px* with a *device pixel ratio of 2*. 
What is the *maximum width of a viewport* in landscape mode measured in *CSS pixels*? 

====
The answer is 960 because 

a device pixel of 2 tells us for every 1 css pixel there are 2 hardware pixels. 
multiply 1920 by one half will give us 960 css pixels.

====



== 2.7 Quiz: How wide is the viewport?

Calculate the width (in DIPs) of the viewport for all of the devices below. Type 
your answer in the boxes on the left. 

* Phone 650px wide, DPR = 2
* Phablet 768px wide, DPR = 2.5
* Tablet 1024px wide, DPR = 1 
* Laptop browser, 800px wide, DPR = 1


====

The answers are:

* 320
* around 300
* 1024
* 800

You divide hardware pixel with the DPR to get the viewport (DIPs) size.
====

== 2.8 Setting the Viewport

Insert this meta to the head element: 

----
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
----

This will tell the browser that we know what we're doing. +

* We need to use the meta viewport value with *=device-width* which will instruct the page to match 
the screen's width in device independent pixels (DIPs).  This allows the page to 
reflow content to match the screen sizes. Whether it is rendered on a small mobile device or a laptop computer.

* Adding *initial-scale=1* instructs the browser to establish a 1 : 1 relationship between DIPs and CSS pixels. If you don't 
give the initial scale=1 setting, some browsers will keep the page width constant when rotating to landscape mode. They also 
scale the content rather than allowing it to reflow.

NOTE: CSS pixels are what we are used to working with most of the time, and it's the only thing we need to worry about.

== 2.9 Large Fixed Width Elements

One of the instructors mention that *relative width* is good for responsive design. 

The other instructor shows what happens when an image that is an absolute position is  very large and shown on different viewports. 


== 2.10 Max-width on Elements

It's important that the content fits within the viewport to prevent horizontal scrolling.

We should use *relative units* when specifying widths for elements to prevent them from 
accidentally overflowing the viewport.

NOTE: Keep in mind, CSS does allow content to overflow its container.  For example the container(div) has a set 
width and the content (image) is larger than that container, it will overflow.

To avoid this from happening, a great thing to use is *max-width: 100%* . 

As a catch all, the instructor recommends adding the max-width: 100% to 
*images, embed, object, and video* elements. Just to be safe.
